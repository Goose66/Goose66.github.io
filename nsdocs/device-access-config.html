        <h1 id="device-access-configuration">Google Cloud and Device Access Project Setup and Configuration</a></h1>
        <p>In order to use the Non-production (Beta) version of the NestSDM plugin, you must first create a Google Cloud
            project with the SDM and Pub/Sub APIs enabled, create and configure an OAuth Client for the Google Cloud
            project, and then create a Google Device Access project and configure it with the OAuth Client and enable
            events processing. Step-by-step instructions follow, but please review the following notes before getting
            started:
            <ul>
                <li>These instructions are based on the current state of the Google Cloud and Device Access consoles as
                    of the time of this writing. Google may change the console layout and configuration steps at any time,
                    so please refer to the Google documentation for the most current information. These steps are adpated
                    for the NestSDM Plugin from the Google Device Access Getting Started Guide which can be found here:
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started">Get Started &nbsp;|&nbsp; Device
                    Access &nbsp;|&nbsp; Google for Developers</a></li>
                <li>You should have already activated your Nest devices in the Google Home app using your Google account.
                    Note that legacy Nest accounts are not supported. You should be using the same Google Account ID 
                    (email address) for accesing the Google Cloud and Google Device Acccess consoles and creating the 
                    relative projects as you used in activating your Nest devices in the Google Home app.</li>
                <li>The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and the Google Device Access Console currently appear to be somewhat
                    separate and isolated platforms, so the configuration will at times appear to  be disjointed. It also
                    appears to be important to do these steps in order for everything to work correctly.</li>
                <li>I suggest having Notepad (or Mac equivalent) open during the configuration so that you can copy and
                    paste the project ID, GCP project ID, OAuth Client ID, and OAuth Client Secret from the various console
                    pages as you go for setting the required Custom Configuration Parameters in the NestSDM plugin once
                    everything is setup.</li>
                <li>If you have already been using Home Assistant (HA) with your Google Nest devices, you may already have
                    the required Google Cloud and Google Device Access projects setup and configured, and these steps are not 
                    necessary. See the Release Notes for the NestSDM Plugin for details.</li>
            </ul></p>
        <h3>Step 1 - Register for Device Access (Device Access Console)</h3>
        <p>Before creating your projects, you must register for Device Access. Registration includes payment of a one-time
            fee (US$5) per account. Registration is done in the Google Device Access Console. You can access the Device
            Access Console here: <a href="https://console.nest.google.com/device-access" target="_blank">Device Access Console</a>. You will
            be asked to agree to the terms of service and such and then register and pay the fee if this is your first time
            in the Device Access Console.</p>            
        <h3>Step 2 - Use the Wizard to Set up Google Cloud Platform</h3>
        <p>Next, you need to setup the GCP Project to support Device Access, enable the SDM API, and create an OAuth client 
            for the project(s). This is all done through a script on the Getting Started Guide webpage that runs a wizard
            that walks you through the details. Here is a step-by-step guide for using the wizard (you will want to
            keep this page open in a separate window/tab for reference):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access/get-started" target="_blank">Google
                    Device Access Getting Started Guide</a> webpage.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Scroll down to the button labeled "Enable the API and get an OAuth 2.0 Client ID" and click it:</p>
                <img src="images/button1.png"  alt="'Enable the API and get an OAuth 2.0 Client ID' button">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the first wizard screen, choose "+ Create a new project" in the "Select or create project" drop-down:</p>
                <img src="images/wizard1.png"  alt="Wizard (1)">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Enter "Nest SDM Plugin" as the new project name and click "NEXT":</p>
                <img src="images/wizard2.png"  alt="Wizard (2)">
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Enter "Nest SDM Plugin" as the product name for the OAuth client and click "NEXT":</p>
                <img src="images/wizard3.png"  alt="Wizard (3)">
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Select "Web server" from the "Where are you calling from?" drop-down and enter
                "https://my.isy.io/api/cloudlink/redirect" as the redirect URI, then click "CREATE":</p>
                <img src="images/wizard4.png"  alt="Wizard (4)">
            </li>                
        </ol>
        <p>Once the GCP Project and OAuth client are created, you can...</p>
        <h3>Step 3 - Access Google Cloud Project in the Dashboard (Google Cloud Console)</h3>
        <p>Next, access the GCP Project you just created in the Google Cloud Dashboard here: <a
            href="https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard" target="_blank">Google Cloud Console - Dashboard</a>. If
            this is your first time in the Google Cloud Console, then the "Nest SDM Plugin" project you created may already
            be selected. If not, click the Project Selection dropdown in the top left corner of the Dashboard, and then select
            the newly created "Nest SDM Plugin" project from the project selection window:</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard1.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (1)"></p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard2.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (2)"></p>          
        <p>Once the "Nest SDM Plugin" project is selected, copy the "Project ID" value in the "Project info" tile at the top
            left Dashboard display. This is the "GCP Project ID" you will need for the NestSDM plugin configuration.</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard3.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (3)"></p>
        <h3>Step 4 - Enable Pub/Sub for the GCP Project (Google Cloud Console)</h3>
        <p>The Nest SDM Plugin uses Push Events from Device Access to update state of devices in IoX. Push Events are enabled 
            by the Google Cloud Pub/Sub API. However, the Pub/Sub API is not enabled for the GCP Project by default, so this
            must be done manually:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>In the "Getting Started" tile of the Dashboard (2 or 3 down on the left), click the "Explore and enable APIs"
                menu item:</p>
                <img src="images/dashboard4.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (4)">
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>At the top of the "APIs & Services" page, click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES":</p>
                <img src="images/dashboard5.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (5)">
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Next, on the "API Library" page, enter "Pub/Sub" in the search bar and then select the "Cloud Pub/Sub API"
                    item in the search results:</p>
                <img src="images/dashboard6.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (6)">
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On the "Cloud Pub/Sub API" page, click the "ENABLE" button to enable the API for the GCP project:</p>
                <img src="images/dashboard7.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (7)">
            </li>
        </ol>           
        <h3>Step 5 - Retrieve OAuth Client settings for GCP Project (Google Cloud Console)</h3>
        <p>Returning to the "API & Services" page, select "Credentials" from the left column menu:</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard8.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (8)"></p>
        <p>On the "Credentials" page, you should see a "Nest SDM Plugin" OAuth Client listed under the "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
            list. Click the "Download OAuth client" (download icon) out to the right of this list item to display the details
            for the "Nest SDM Plugin" OAuth client. Copy the "Client ID" and "Client secret" values from the display. You will
            need these for the NestSDM plugin configuration.</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard9.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (9)"></p>
        <h3>Step 6 - Set the Publishing Status of GCP Project to "In Production" (Google Cloud Console)</h3>
        <p>The GCP project is initially created with a publishing status of "Testing." In this status, your OAuth Authorization
            to the Device Access project will expire after 7 days and you will have to re-authorize. In order to prevent this, 
            the status of the GCP project must be set to "In Production." Returning to the "API & Services" page, select
            "OAuth consent screen" from the left column menu:</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard10.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (8)"></p>
        <p>On the "Oauth consent screen" page, click the "PUBLISH APP" button under the "Publishing status" section:</p>
        <p><img src="images/dashboard11.png"  alt="GCP Dashboard (9)"></p>
        <p>You will receive a confirmation dialog warning you that your project will be accessible to all users. While a user
            could conceivably authenticate to your project if they were given the authorization URL, this would simply expose
            their Google Nest Devices to your plugin, and wouldn't expose any information pertaining to your Google ID
            externally. Click the "CONFIRM" button on the confirmation dialog.</p>
        <h3>Step 7 - Create a Device Access Project (Device Access Console)</h3>
        <p>Finally (really?!?) you create a Device Access project. This is done in a wizard in the Google Device Access console. You will need to the
            Client ID of the OAuth client created above in Step 5 for this step:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Access the Device Access Console here: <a
                href="https://console.nest.google.com/device-access" target="_blank">Device Access Console</a>. Click on the "Create project"
                tile.</p>
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Enter a project name of "Nest SDM Plugin" and click the "Next" button.</p>
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Enter the OAuth client ID copied from the Google Cloud Console in Step 5 above and click the "Next"
                    button.</p>
            </li>                
            <li>
                <p>Select "Enable" for the Events and click the "Create project" button.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the Device Access Project is created, you will see a tile for it in the Device Access Console:</p>
        <img src="images/daconsole1.png"  alt="Device Access Console (1)">
        <p>Clicking on the "Nest SDM Plugin" project tile will display the details for the project. Copy the 
            "Project ID" value for the project for the NestSDM plugin configuration. You may also want to verify that the 
            proper OAuth client ID was supplied and that the Pub/Sub topic (for Events) shows as "Enabled."</p>
