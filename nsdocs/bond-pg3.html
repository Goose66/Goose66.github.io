    <hr>
    <p>A plugin for Polyglot v3 (PG3) that interfaces with Olibra Bond Bridges and Smart by Bond (SBB) devices locally to allow
        the ISY to control ceiling fans, lights, blinds, fireplaces, and more. See https://bondhome.io/ for more information on
        Olibra Bond Bridge.</p>
    <p><b>NOTICE:</b> This plugin requires IoX 5.8.3 or better be installed on your Polisy or eISY to run.</p>
    <h3 id="instructions">Instructions for Installation of Plugin:</h3>
    <p>From the Polyglot Dashboard:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the Bond plugin from the PG3x Plugin Store.</li>
        <li>Once the BondBridge node server is running, unlock the Bond devices on your network (e.g., power cycle your Bond
            bridge(s)) and then click "Discover" in the Dashboard to load nodes for each device discovered. Once a bridge is
            unlocked by power cycling, you have 10 minutes to intiate the Discover command. THIS PROCESS MAY TAKE SEVERAL
            SECONDS depending on the number of Bond Bridges and devices there are, so please be patient and wait a minute or
            two before retrying. Also, please check the Polyglot Dashboard for messages regarding Discover failure
            conditions.</li>
    </ol>   
    <h3 id="release-notes">Notes for latest version (v3.2.14)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Your Bond bridge may not be discoverable by the automatic Discover routine depending on the configuration of your
            network and Wi-Fi. If your Bond Bridge or SBB device is not discoverable, you may connect to it manually by adding
            the following Custom Configuration Parameters under Configuration in the Polyglot Dashboard and then re-running
            the Discover command:
            <ul>
                <li>key: hostname, value: locally accessible hostname or IP address for Bond Bridge (e.g.,
                    &quot;192.168.1.145&quot; or &quot;ZZBL45678.local&quot;)</li>
                <li>key: token, value: local access token for Bond Bridge. Available in the &quot;Bond Settings&rarr;Advanced
                    Settings" for the bridge in the Bond Home mobile app.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also specify multiple Bond Bridges and/or SBB devices for Discovery in Custom Configuration Parameters
                by specifying a hostname and token for each, separated by semicolons (&semi;) in the &quot;hostname&quot; and
                &quot;token&quot; parameters. Make sure that the corresponding values are specified in the same order.</p>
        </li>
        <li>The plugin utilizes mDNS (Bonjour) service disovery to discover the Bond bridges on the LAN. There is an 11 second
            delay in the discovery code to allow the bridges to respond to the mDNS query before the bridge nodes are created.
            After pressing Discovery, you may see no signs of activity in the next several seconds. This is normal. Please be
            patient.</li>
        <li>To discover new devices added to an existing Bridge node, you can use the Discover routine as before. It is not
            necessary to unlock bridges for existing Bridge nodes to discover new devices, however, you will receive a
            notification warning that the bridge needs to be unlocked. You can ignore this.</li>
        </li>
        <li>The Plugin Status is only tracked in the first bridge node created by the plugin. If you delete this bridge node,
            you will lose Plugin Status tracking. If you delete all the bridge nodes and re-Discover, the Plugin Status will
            be tracked in the first bridge node created upon re-discovery.</li>
        <li>You can optionally modify the polling interval by changing the &quot;shortPoll&quot; configuration parameter under
            Configuration - Advanced Configuration. Note that the default is 60 seconds, and because the Bond Bridge provides
            instantaneous state updates over UDP (BPUP), frequent polling for state is not required. The &quot;longPoll&quot;
            value is not used.</li>
        <li>Only very basic functionality is available for shades, fireplaces, and generic devices (just Open/Close or On/Off
            functionality). Additional functionality will be added when users with these devices are available to test new
            code.</li>
        <li>The ST driver of Ceiling Fan nodes reflects the current speed of the fan as a percentage of the maximum speed,
            with 0 being 0% (Off) and the maximum speed being 100%. In order to set the fan to a specific, known speed, use
            the Set Speed command. The Set Speed command lets you set the speed to up to 10 speed numbers. Speed numbers over
            the maximum speed set the fan to the maximum speed.</li>
        <li>If your fan has an uplight and downlight, the nodserver will create two light nodes that you can turn on and off
            seperately. The result of setting the brightness level of either (if available) is unknown since I did not have
            such a fan to test with.</li>
        <li>Increase Speed (&percnt;) and Decrease Speed (&percnt;) increase and decrese the fan speed percentage by approx.
            3&percnt;. This is to mimic BRT and DIM commands in Insteon which brighten and dim lights/devices over 32 steps.
            The hope is that you can drop a SwitchLinc dimmer in a scene with the fan and the bright/dim functionality will
            work intuitively over the LEDs displayed to control the fan speed. Increase Speed (&num;) and Decrease Speed
            (&num;) increase and decrease the fan speed by one speed number.</li>
