    <hr>
    <p>A plugin for Polyglot v3 (PG3) that interfaces with a Honeywell Vista series alarm panel through EnvisaLink™
        EVL-3/4 and DUO™ adapaters from EyezOn. See <a href="http://www.eyezon.com/">http://www.eyezon.com/</a> for more
        information.</p>
    <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
    <p>Before installing the plugin, make sure your EnvisaLink device is connected to your compatible
        Honeywell/Ademco Vista alarm panel and your home network and is accessible via a web browser at
        <a href="http://envisalink.local">http://envisalink.local</a> or http://&lt;device IP>. You will need to know the
            user ID (&quot;user&quot;) and password (defaults to &quot;user&quot;) for the EnvisaLink device. In addition,
            make sure that the additional programming steps for your alarm panel have been performed to ensure full functionality with the
            EnvisaLink device, as outlined in the installation instructions. The installation instructions may
            be found here (last verified 2022-09-28):</p>

    <h3 id="instructions-for-installation-of-node-server">Instructions for installation of plugin:</h3>
    <p>From the Polyglot Dashboard:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the EnvisaLink-HW plugin from the PG3x Plugin Store.</li>
        <li>In the PG3x Dashboard, select the installed plugin and then add/modify the following required Custom
            Configuration Parameters under Configuration (note that the keys should automatically be added for
            required parameters):
            <ul>
                <li>key: hostname, value: locally accessible hostname or IP address of EnvisaLink or DUO device (e.g.,
                    &quot;envisalink.local&quot; or &quot;192.168.1.145&quot;)</li>
                <li>key: password, value: password for EnvisaLink device</li>
                <li>key: usercode, value: user code for disarming alarm panel (e.g., &quot;5555&quot;)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>You can also add the following optional Configuration Parameters under Configuration:<ul>
                <li>key: numpartitions, value: number of partition nodes to generate (defaults to 1)</li>
                <li>key: numzones, value: number of zone nodes to generate (defaults to 8)</li>
                <li>key: disablewatchdog, value: 0 or 1 for whether EyezOn cloud service watchdog timer should be
                    disabled (defaults to 0 - not disabled)</li>
                <li>key: zonetimerdumpflag, value: numeric flag indicating whether dumping of the zone timers should be
                    done on shortpoll (1), longpoll (2), or disabled altogether (0) (defaults to 1 - shortpoll)</li>
                <li>key: smartzonetracking, value: 0 or 1 for whether plugin should use a heuristic to track zone
                    status (open, closed) or just rely on EnvisaLink (defaults to 0 - do not track)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>PLEASE NOTE</strong>: Once the required configuration parameters have been saved, the plugin will create
        the panel, partition, and zone nodes in the next shortpoll event, and then attempt to connect to the EnvisaLink
        device and update all of the panel, partition, and zone states over multiple, subsequent shortpoll events. It may
        take two or three minutes depending on the shortpoll interval before all nodes and states are reflected properly in
        IoX, so please be patient. Check the Polyglot Dashboard for notices regarding bad configuration parameters and
        connection failure conditions.</p>
    <h3 id="using-the-node-server-events-commands">Using the plugin events (commands)</h3>
    <p>The nodes of the EnvisaLink-Vista Plugin generate the following incoming commands to IoX, allowing the nodes
        to be added as controllers to scenes and the commands to be used as triggers in programs:</p>
    <p>PARTITION</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sends a <em>DON</em> (&quot;Alarm Triggered&quot;) command when the partition is alarming</li>
        <li>Sends a <em>DOF</em> (&quot;Alarm Restored&quot;) command when the partition is disarmed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>PANEL</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sends an <em>AWAKE</em> (&quot;Heartbeat&quot;) command periodically for heartbeat monitoring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="notes-for-latest-version-v314">Notes for latest version (v3.1.4)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Known issues:</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On Entry Delay (but not Exit Delay?) any Battery Trouble status will vacillate between True and False every
            couple of seconds due to the seemingly random nature of the keypad update messages that the plugin relies
            on for much of its state tracking.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="2">
        <li>If the connection to the EnvisaLink is lost, or if the plugin doesn&#39;t hear from the EnvisaLink for
            20
            seconds, then the connection is reset and the plugin will attempt reconnect on the next short poll and
            every subsequent short poll until connection is reestablished or the plugin is shutdown.</li>
        <li>Any change to &quot;usercode&quot;, &quot;disablewatchdog&quot;, &quot;zonetimerdumpflag&quot;, or
            &quot;smartzonetracking&quot; parameters while the plugin is running should take effect immediately
            (i.e.
            at next time the related functions run). Any change to the &quot;hostname&quot; or &quot;password&quot;
            parameters while the plugin is running will be used on the next conection attempt to the EnvisaLink,
            whether the initial connection or a reconnect. If you change the &quot;numpartitions&quot; or
            &quot;numzones&quot; parameters after the AlarmPanel node has been created, you must restart the plugin for
            these new parameter values to take effect.</li>
        <li>If your EnvisaLink is firewalled and can not connect to the EyezOn web service, then the EnvisaLink will reboot
            every 20 minutes (&quot;Watchdog Timer&quot;) in order to try and reestablish the connection to the web service.
            This will kill the connection to the plugin as well and it will (attempt to) reconnect on the next short
            poll. If you set the &quot;diablewatchdog&quot; configuration setting to 1, the plugin will send a periodic
            poll to the EnvisaLink to reset the Watchdog Timer so that the EnvisaLink won&#39;t reboot. The poll is sent
            every long poll if the &quot;diablewatchdog&quot; configuration parameter is set, so the &quot;longpoll&quot;
            configuration setting needs to be less than 1200 seconds (20 minutes).</li>
        <li>The zone timers (&quot;Time Closed&quot;) represent the time since the last closing of the zone, in seconds, and
            are calculated in 5 second intervals. The timers have a maximum value of 327675 seconds (91 hours) and won&#39;t
            count up beyond that. The timing of the zone timer updates is based on the configured zonetimerdumpflag
            parameter (defaults to every short poll). </li>
        <li>With SmartZoneTracking enabled, the plugin keeps up with the state of zones (open, closed) instead of
            relying on the EnvisaLink&#39;s zone state tracking. States for bypassed zones show as &quot;Unknown.&quot; If
            the feature is disabled, then the plugin relies on the zone state tracking in the EnvisaLink. Either way,
            zone states are squirrely. This is why the Zone nodes don't send DON and DOF commands on opening and closing,
            respectively, like those of the EnvisaLink DSC plugin do.</li>
        <li>Bypass and SmartZoneTracking (probably) only work for zones in partition 1. The behavior for zones in other
            partitions is undefined.</li>
